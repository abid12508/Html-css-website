	<div class="div1"> <h3>introduction </h3> <p> Hi, my name is Abid. I like to program CSS, HTML5, and Python.
	css is as easy as html5.
	I am coding this website with both of the languages.
	I started to get interested in coding when I programmed HTML.
	I also like other things like, games, piano, and chess. 
	 I want to become a better programmer than the programmer I am right now.
I learned my programming from Codecademy. This website can teach you python 2, HTML, and CSS.

	<div class="div2"> <h3> Hobbies </h3>
	<p> <span class="test">My hobbies are about playing piano and programming.</span> I like to play piano because I listen to piano 
		all the time. I also like to play chess because it helps me think about the future. Talking about my future, 
		I really like programming to the point where I want to make it a career. I like to use python and HTML/CSS.
		with HTML/CSS I can make websites, and with python I can learn about machines and artificial intellegence.
		Python is easy to learn and understand, but it can be a bit challenging if you are solving puzzels.
		And of course, My favorite hobby is playing games. I really like shooters or maybe other games that are 
		not very hard. I have played a lot of games. Minecraft, Rocket League, Valorant, Counter Strike Globle Offensive, all of them. 
		I remember playing on the WII and the PlayStation3.

	<div class="lastparagraph"><h3>school</h3> <p>I think school is very easy. Probably because I learned ahead of time, but I think it's just for fun.
		I dont really think that school is boring. I honestly like school because it can take my mind off things. School can also help me 
		learn programming languages. Right now, c# is hard because there is so many things you can do with it. I also have alot of friends
		that can help me with programming. One day, I might just be the best programmer.
