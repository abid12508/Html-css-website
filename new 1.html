	<div class="div1"> <h4> introduction </h6> <p> Hi, my name is Abid. I like to program CSS, HTML5, and Python.
	css is as easy as html5.
	I am coding this website with both of the languages.
	I started to get interested in coding when I programmed HTML.
	I also like other things like, games, piano, and chess. 
	 I want to become a better programmer than the programmer I am right now.
I learned my programming from Codecademy. This website can teach you python 2, HTML, and CSS for free.

	<div class="div2"> <h4> Hobbies </h4>
	<p> My hobbies are about playing piano and programming. I like to play piano because I listen to piano 
		all the time. I also like to play chess because it helps me think about the future. Talking about my future, 
		I really like programming to the point where I want to make it a career. I like to use python and HTML/CSS.
		with HTML/CSS I can make websites, and with python I can learn about machines and artificial intellegence.
		Python is easy to learn and understand, but it can be a bit challenging if you are solving puzzels.
		And of course, My favorite hobby is playing games. I really like shooters or maybe other games that are 
		not very hard. I have played a lot of games. Minecraft, Rocket League, Valorant, all of them. 
		I remember playing on the WII and the PlayStation3.
